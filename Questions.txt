Divide an array into K subarray with the given condition

Given an array arr[] and an integer K. The task is to divide the array into K parts ( subarray ) such that the sum of the values of all subarray is minimum.

The value of every subarray is defined as:

    Take the maximum from that subarray.
    Subtract each element of the subarray with the maximum.
    Take the sum of all the values after subtraction.

The task is to minimize the sum of the values after dividing the array into K parts.

Examples:

    Input: arr[] = { 2, 9, 5, 4, 8, 3, 6 }, K = 2
    Output: 19
    Explanation:
    The two groups are : {2} with max = 2 and {9, 5, 4, 8, 3, 6} with max=9,
    sum of difference of first group = 2 – 2 = 0,
    sum of difference of second group = (9-9) + (9-5) + (9-4) + (9-8) + (9-3) + (9-6) = 19

    Input: arr[] = { 12, 20, 30, 14, 25}, K = 3
    Output: 19 
	
	
	

Maximum number of given operations to remove the entire string

Given a string str containing lowercase English characters, we can perform the following two operations on the given string:

    Remove the entire string.
    Remove a prefix of the string str[0…i] only if it is equal to the sub-string str[(i + 1)…(2 * i + 1)].

The task is to find the maximum number of operations required to delete the entire string.

Examples:

    Input: str = “abababab”
    Output: 4
    Operation 1: Delete prefix “ab” and the string becomes “ababab”.
    Operation 2: Delete prefix “ab” and the string becomes “abab”.
    Operation 3: Delete prefix “ab”, str = “ab”.
    Operation 4: Delete the entire string.

    Input: s = “abc”
    Output: 1 
	
	

Maximum sum combination from two arrays

Given two arrays arr1[] and arr2[] each of size N. The task is to choose some elements from both the arrays such that no two elements have the same index and no two consecutive numbers can be selected from a single array. Find the maximum sum possible of above-chosen numbers.

Examples:

    Input : arr1[] = {9, 3, 5, 7, 3}, arr2[] = {5, 8, 1, 4, 5}
    Output : 29
    Select first, third and fivth element from the first array.
    Select the second and fourth element from the second array.

    Input : arr1[] = {1, 2, 9}, arr2[] = {10, 1, 1}
    Output : 19
    Select last element from the first array and first element from the second array. 
	
	

Alternate XOR operations on sorted array

Given an array arr[] and two integers X and K. The task is to perform the following operation on array K times:

    Sort the array.
    XOR every alternate element of the sorted array with X i.e. arr[0], arr[2], arr[4], …

After repeating the above steps K times, print the maximum and the minimum element in the modified array.

Examples:

    Input: arr[] = {9, 7, 11, 15, 5}, K = 1, X = 2
    Output: 7 13
    Since the operations has to be performed only once,
    the sorted array will be {5, 7, 9, 11, 15}
    Now, apply xor with 2 on alternate elements i.e. 5, 9 and 15.
    {5 ^ 2, 7, 9 ^ 2, 11, 15 ^ 2} which is equal to
    {7, 7, 11, 11, 13}

    Input: arr[] = {605, 986}, K = 548, X = 569
    Output: 605 986

Cost Based Tower of Hanoi

The standard Tower of Hanoi problem is explained here . In the standard problem, all the disc transactions are considered identical. Given a 3×3 matrix costs[][] containing the costs of transfer of disc between the rods where costs[i][j] stores the cost of transferring a disc from rod i to rod j. Cost of transfer between the same rod is 0. Hence the diagonal elements of the cost matrix are all 0s. The task is to print the minimum cost in which all the N discs are transferred from rod 1 to rod 3.

    Transfer the smaller disc from rod 1 to rod 2.
    Cost of this transfer is equal to 1
    Transfer the bigger disc to from rod 1 to rod 3.
    Cost of this transfer is equal to 2.

Minimum time required to rot all oranges | Dynamic Programming

Given a matrix of dimension m * n where each cell in the matrix can have values 0, 1 or 2 which has the following meaning:

0: Empty cell

1: Cells have fresh oranges

2: Cells have rotten oranges

So the task is to determine what is the minimum time required so that all the oranges become rotten. A rotten orange at index [i, j] can rot other fresh oranges at indexes [i – 1, j], [i + 1, j], [i, j – 1], [i, j + 1] (up, down, left and right). If it is impossible to rot every orange then simply return -1.

Examples:

    Input: arr[][] = {
    {2, 1, 0, 2, 1},
    {1, 0, 1, 2, 1},
    {1, 0, 0, 2, 1}};
    Output: 2
    In the first unit of time, all the oranges will be rotten
    except the first orange of the last row
    which will get rotten in the second unit of time.

    Input: arr[][] =
    {{2, 1, 0, 2, 1},
    {0, 0, 1, 2, 1},
    {1, 0, 0, 2, 1}};
    Output: -1 
	
	

Coin Change | BFS Approach

Given an integer X and an array arr[] of length N consisting of positive integers, the task is to pick minimum number of integers from the array such that they sum up to N. Any number can be chosen infinite number of times. If no answer exists then print -1.

Examples:

    Input: X = 7, arr[] = {3, 5, 4}
    Output: 2
    The minimum number elements will be 2 as
    3 and 4 can be selected to reach 7.

    Input: X = 4, arr[] = {5}
    Output: -1 
	
	

Flip minimum signs of array elements to get minimum sum of positive elements possible

Given an array of positive elements, you have to flip the sign of some of its elements such that the resultant sum of the elements of array should be minimum non-negative (as close to zero as possible). Return the minimum no. of elements whose sign needs to be flipped such that the resultant sum is minimum non-negative. Note that the sum of all the array elements will not exceed 104.

Examples:

    Input: arr[] = {15, 10, 6}
    Output: 1
    Here, we will flip the sign of 15
    and the resultant sum will be 1.

    Input: arr[] = [14, 10, 4]
    Output: 1
    Here, we will flip the sign of 14 and the resultant sum will be 0.
    Note that flipping the signs of 10 and 4 also gives
    the resultant sum 0 but the count of flipped elements is not minimum.
